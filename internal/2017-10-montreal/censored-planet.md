# Censored Planet (CP)

1. Requesting the HTTP pages of all the domains around the world, and checking which ones RST connections.

The idea is to identify anomalous measurements and then send those to OONI for further follow-up measurements (to determine whether or not they are actually blocked).

2. Examining cases when servers block access from specific countries

Looking at pages that will likely look different in specific countries. 

This can be examined by using Web Connectivity with a custom test list (popular sites that may be blocking access from specific countries).

This will be examined globally, and not limited to embargoed countries. It will be a combination of technical and policy research. 

3. Looking at the test list process --- generating more objective test lists, with less bias.

Take a list of newly registered domains (from last 24 hours) and test all of them. 

## Collaboration

1. OONI doing follow-up measurements based on CP tests (Probe Orchestration)

2. Cross-referencing datasets (Analyzing data)

3. Integrating CP data into the OONI pipeline (Integrating data)
