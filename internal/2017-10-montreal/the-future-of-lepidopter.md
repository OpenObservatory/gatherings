# The Future of Lepidopter

Do we want to take the existing Lepidopter forward? Or do we want to have a new IoT type of distribution for ooniprobe?

## Questions

1. What do we see the future in terms of people running ooniprobe on embedded computers? Do people order stuff and we ship hardware to them? Do we gear this more to more technical audiences who already have single-purpose computers (in which case having a single way of burning images in optimal)? Or all of the above?

Perhaps having one recommended way is the best way to go? This could make our lives better.

2. How do we feel about using embedded devices? 

It's a pity to not continue to have this thing. There are many scenarios where having this can be useful. 

Deploy your own vs. we give it to you ===> Both require some amount of energy and time.

The design choices of how we technically implement the one or the other influences the deployment scenario where the user provisions the machine themselves or they get a box that we control properly.

Even if we get a supplier for resolving shipping etc., it will still require a fair amount of work. 

3. Is this a product that there is a sizeable number of users that care about? By putting this product out there, does it being back a large number of measurements?

4. How do we support our partners during the months leading up to the deployment of the desktop apps?

We get them to run OONI Probe on mobile, and on macOS. 

If we decide to do the drop-shipping, we also need to bill for our time (in addition to the cost of the raw pieces) in the budget.

If we do another round of these, we need to have a roaming SIM card (so that if you have support problems, we can support you better). -- hologram.io

The IoT version of OONI Probe needs someone who spear-heads it. Someone needs to be product owner of this thing. This means:

* Finding money

* Creating a plan

* Executing the plan

etc etc etc.

What is the vision for ooniprobe IoT?

* Many deployments (similarly to Ripe Atlas)

* More analytical measurements -- more depth in terms of what is tested

* More diversity in terms of vantage points

## Potential next steps

1. Create a design document for what ooniprobe IoT will look like

2. Write and submit a funding proposal (get funding to support this project)

We should explore collaboration with Ripe Atlas.
