# Revamping the OONI website

New content pages:

* FAQ

* Community materials

* Training materials

* Separate research reports and blogs

* Press mentions

* How others are using OONI data/ OONI Probe as part of their work

We will include a CMS for the website. If the CMS is nice enough, we could even include a CMS for the apps.

Reasonable access control to translators so that they can translate our content.

Support adding media content (e.g. images).

Contentful is a CMS we're considering... It has an API including scripts that dump down the data to series of json documents. We can store the data in git (the data is in markdown and json).

Gasby is sort of a static site generator. 

Include a screen cast of running ooniprobe ==> include this in the Install page.
