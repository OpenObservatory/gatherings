# Testing clients

In this session we brainstormed the future of testing clients.

## Session notes

The type of platform you target depends a lot on the region.

* Tagging of data based on network type and location.

* With partners requires a lot of manual coordination.

* Difficulty to getting the hardware deployed.

Data costs may are significant, USB 3G modems are not supported by lepidopter
(and monopolising the modem is bad too), Wi-Fi is complex to setup at lepidopter,
there may be no affordable "residential" landlines in developing countries.

One of the key takeaways from this session is that in the long run we will not
be investing that much energy in a hardware based deployment strategy, but
rather favour desktop and mobile clients.

Speaking desktop, it seems, that windows should be supported somehow. OTOH,
most of NGOs staff have Apple's Macs and are OK with Mac-only version.

We should provide *"secure uninstallation guide"* to ooniprobe users as a
counterpart of informed consent and our commitment to be less fingerprintable.
