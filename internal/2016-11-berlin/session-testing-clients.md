# Testing clients

In this session we brainstormed the future of testing clients.

## Session notes

The type of platform you target depends a lot on the region.

* Tagging of data based on network type and location.

* With partners requires a lot of manual coordination.

* Difficulty to getting the hardware deployed.

One of the key takeaways from this session is that in the long run we will not
be investing that much energy in a hardware based deployment strategy, but
rather favour desktop and mobile clients.
