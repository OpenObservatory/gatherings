# OONI Explorer User Stories

I'm a blogger (or journalist) and I want to include the graph I found in
the explorer page inside my page (like a widget) to have an interactive graph
that links to the OONI page.

I am a user and access India in OONI explorer. It tells me that 27/32 websites
are blocked.  Which are these 27 websites? Also I heard that more sites have
been blocked. Why are they not here?

---

I am a user and I don't understand the "vendor" information. Where/Who is this
vendor and what is it doing?

country to implement censorship so I can remediate for it.

---

I am a DPI vendor and want to understand which technology is used in a country
to see if I can/should enter its market.
