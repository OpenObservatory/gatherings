# OONI GUI

In this session we discussed all things around the OONI GUI

## Session notes

We discussed the approach of having an app that is "one size fits all" vs many
apps that do one part of the problem.
One of the arguments for the later was that we wanted to reduce the cognitive
load.

It was suggested to disable informed consent for certain tests or user
initiated tests.

We could have two modes of operation censorship tests vs performance tests.

A good example of a similar desktop UI that features a web interface is
Transmission.
