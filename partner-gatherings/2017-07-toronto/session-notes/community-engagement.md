# Community Engagement

* Workshops/trainings: Tech people all about ooniprobe, why and how they can use it as part of their work and/or daily lives

* Multimedia: Teach how OONI works (e.g. through animations, videos, visualizations, etc.)

* Adapt OONI workshops/trainings to local context

* Finding local partners

* Monthly OONI community meetings on slack.openobersvatory.org

* Localization (translations, etc.)

* Push notifications: Inform people of emerging censorship events and encourage them to run ooniprobe (retaining community members)

## Narratives

Why does measuring internet censorship matter?

* Freedom of expression

* Access to information

* Transparency and accountability

Blocking is often a political decision.

Common things people say:

* The censorship in my country is legally/ethically justifiable

* There is no censorship in my country

Running ooniprobe allows citizens to examine whether the censorship being implemented is actually legally and/or ethically justifiable, it enables public debate around these issues.

Useful to provide examples of how internet censorship impacts people's lives. We can refer to case studies from around the world.

## How to engage users safely

* We should always be upfront about potential risks when engaging new users.

* Informed consent procedure (included in ooniprobe clients).

* We need more opt-out options when using ooniprobe -- people need to be able to make choices depending on what they feel comfortable with. For example, enable users to choose which URLs and/or categories of URLs to test.

* We need a map with relevant laws for each country. This could potentially be collected by OONI's community. Include dates so that the information is not misleading when out of date. Update data once or three times per year. We should also include citations.
