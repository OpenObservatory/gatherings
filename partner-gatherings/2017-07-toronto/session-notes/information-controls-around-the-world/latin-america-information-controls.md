# Latin America: Information Controls

## Argentina

* Judicial decissions (that we know already) that "force" ISPs to block Ã¼ber and Piratebay

* Zero rating is not allowed based on tellecommunication regulations/ national laws, however mobile carriers "do whatever they like" to monetize the market.

## Chile

* Collection of a number of OONI reports reports from some ISPs

* No detected cases of blocking/censorship

* OONI data have not been analyzed yet

* Intentional "technical issues" block access to riseup domains (DNS Hijacking)

## Brazil

* Judge (wrongfully) ordered to block country wide WhatsApp (3 times)

* Blocking of WhatsApp "paralyzes" commication in Brazil as it's the main medium to talk/chat/txt

* Net neutrality: Bandwidth throttling on torrents/streaming network resources, currently not checked, Marco Civil law doesn't allow data discrimination

## Region wide

Mobile data zero rating: WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter
