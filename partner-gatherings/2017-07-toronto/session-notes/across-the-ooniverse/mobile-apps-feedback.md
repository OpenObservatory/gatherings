# OONI Mobile Apps - Feedback

Discussion around ooniprobe's mobile apps and upcoming new features: push notifications and URI scheme.

The discussion was more centered on how to improve the app and while
talking about the current and future features these ideas came up: 

* Add url manually for web connectivity test, this came up very often

* URI scheme protection: preventing people to abuse it maybe to get
traffic to their website.

* Contribute to the test lists from the app in an easy way

* Add a feature to allow users to change the language of the app from the settings,
this came up in a scenario of some people using the phone in English but
they are from Iran so Arabic would be a better choice.

* Risk screen (informed consent) based on user's location

Other ideas brought up:

* Re run same url list from a test result (maybe compare old vs new
results?)

* Choose different test list (by country)

* Filter test list (by category, to avoid testing porn for example)

* Auto update test lists
