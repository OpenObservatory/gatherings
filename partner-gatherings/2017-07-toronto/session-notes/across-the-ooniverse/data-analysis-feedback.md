# Data Analysis & Censorship Alert System

Key takeaways:

* We may want to build some network of volunteers subscribing to alerts
  and writing comments on these alerts as events unfold, providing
  some local context.

* There are numerous requests to make the OONI data accessible (in terms
  of data format):
- ... and to make our methodology more public
- ... and to provide some service that can do some visualisations of
  OONI data within several mouse clicks

* Weekly email emitted by the Censorship Alert System is also useful to some
  users! E.g. Users may be writing monthly reports on state of network
  filtering and they are OK trading delay for lower false positive rates.
