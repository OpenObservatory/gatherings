# Lepidopter - feedback

Partners provided comments and experiences with using Lepidopter.

Feature requests:

* Lepidopter on cheaper devices (than Rasspberry Pi), eg: OrangePi

* WiFi support
 
* Add documentation section on the website about successful case studies of Lepidopter usage, difference betweens tests.

* ooniprobe, implement for a modular based system (test plugins) such as an app store

* Set time of measurements, improve/add WUI ooniprobe/OS configuration 

* Lepidopter/probes monitoring system: check that everything is setup

* Document section of the website: Differences of the mobile app, ooniprobe desktop version, lepidopter

* Compression is the key to network bandwidth minimization

* Default number of concurrent measurements, perhaps we should lower down the number of concurrent to lepidopter, as we don't care how fast the tests will be completed.
