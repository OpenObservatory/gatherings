# OONI Explorer - Feedback

* Filter by ASN

* Add feature that allows the user to check if a probe is online

* List/Filter ASNs per country

* Ability to check whether middleboxes have been detected in other ASNs in the same country as well

* List sites confirmed to be blocked vs. potential false positives

* List potential censorship cases in a different colour

* Explain that middleboxes aren't always bad (i.e. they could be used for legitimate networking purposes)

* Develop more research methods for identifying middleboxes

* Explain vendors better

* Rename "vendor" to "middlebox"

* Provide a section within OONI Explorer that allows people to provide information confirming a censorship event (in relation to what is flagged as a false positive)

* Export data in csv files!

* List how many tests have been performed per country within OONI Explorer

* Currently OONI Explorer includes 2 datasets: (1) Amount of measurements collected per country, (2) Confirmed censorship cases. These datasets should not be included in the same map. They should perhaps be separated into 2 separate maps/visualizations.

* Provide a guide on how to read/interpret the technical data provided in OONI Explorer // Provide a one line description for the technical data.

* Provide a list of blocked sites + types of blocked sites per country. Allow users to compare this information across countries.

* Enable users to test URLs included in the test list of other (regional) countries and provide this comparative analysis within OONI Explorer.

* Sort blocked sites by most recent.

* Ability to export graphs.

* Create a resource for collecting blockpages and middlebox fingerprints.

* Update lists of blocked sites based on latest findings (automatically)

* Create a platform for reporting (and sharing) blockpages.

* Ability to only filter anomalous measurements.

* Ability to only filter sites confirmed to be blocked.

* Show the amount and types of ASNs tested within a pie chart per country.

* For countries or ASNs missing measurements, provide a platform which enables users to share a link to encourage others to run ooniprobe.
