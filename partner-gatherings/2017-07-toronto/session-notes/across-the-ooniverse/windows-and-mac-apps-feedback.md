# Upcoming ooniprobe apps for Windows and macOS - feedback

Currently we have ooniprobe apps for Android & iOS. You can also run ooniprobe via Linux and macOS, as well as on Raspberry Pis.

Going forward, we aim to create native ooniprobe apps for Windows and macOS, that will be as easy to install and use as possible.

Similarly to the mobile apps, the engine powering the desktop apps is MeasurementKit (network measurement library).

## Partner feedback in relation to the upcoming apps for Windows and macOS

* Ability to test specific URLs

* Ability to choose which categories of URLs to test

* Ability to share other results (along with yours) when you complete a measurement

* Regional context outside of your ISP/country

* When ooniprobe says something like "blocked" specify how it was blocked (e.g. blockpage, reset, etc.)

* Show ISP name if possible

* Maybe "does this look correct" checkboxes

* Show how much bandwidth is being used / limit data to a cap

* Common pitfalls: Accidentally perform measurements over a VPN
