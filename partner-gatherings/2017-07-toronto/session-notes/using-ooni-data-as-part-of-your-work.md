# Using OONI data as part of your work

OONI Dimensions:

* Advocacy

* Research

* Legal

* Technology

* Journalism/media

Discussion of past and current projects using OONI data.

Being able to have a timeline of what gets blocked and when provides insight into the media landscapes and understanding the nature of what is getting blocked.

The case of Venezuela is interesting – they did a study on internet censorship around the elections through the use of ooniprobe.

How we would like to use OONI data in the future:

* Influencing decisions at the UN – sharing data with policy makers

* Monitoring annual trends and communicating that through reports

* Campaigns based on OONI data

* Rapid response advocacy

* Outreach to civil society to both grassroots organizations and policy organizations

* You can improve the development of circumvention tools based on OONI data
