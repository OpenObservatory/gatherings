# Sharing Partner Experience & Challenges: Asia

## Experience

1. Received blocklist from KSC (South Korea)
2. Running ooniprobe in various Asian countries

## Challenges

1. Technical help needed to re-programme lepidopter when to run tests
2. Internet connectivity – may cost 300 dollars per month but we only have 2MG. Very slow internet and limited bandwidth – when ooniprobe is running, no one in the office can work.  And they can't have ooniprobe run outside of office hours, because they shut down the power after office hours.
3. Hard to develop local test lists --- people don't want to contribute for free.
4. Hard to run ooniprobe for a long time due to security concerns and high cost.
5. Localizing research --- advocacy work is time-sensitive, and it needs to happen right after the publication of a report--- but lack of funding and other resources limits the localtion of the report and subsequent advocacy work.
6. Understanding legal risks.
7. Anti-defamation law – anyone can get sued if they post something sensitive. People have been prosecuted under this law, particularly those criticizing the military. Such laws make people self-censor – which is more prevalent than internet censorship.
8. Localisation especially important for orchestration notifications.

## Needs

1. Localization – costs for localizing reports and other content.
2. Funding – to make support of work possible.
3. OONI could do compression to consumer half of the bandwidth consumed. Reduce bandwidth consumption is very important.
4. Identify the content deleted/removed from sites by government
5. Don't run ooniprobe while using mobile data.
6. Funding/contribution to support the data costs (incentives of some sort).
