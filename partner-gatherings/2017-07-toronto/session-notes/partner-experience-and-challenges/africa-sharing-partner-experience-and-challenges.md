# Sharing Partner Experience & Challenges: Africa

## Experience

Started in 2015, and started deploying lepidopter in May 2016. They started using ooniprobe when it was only in the command line.

Challenges – place to test securely, engaging new users.

Did training to teach researchers to use ooniprobe – the tests spiked after the web UI was depoyed, and after the mobile apps were deployed.

The amount of countries expanded, and engaging new users was easier.

Hard to get data from high-risk environments, hard to get people's trust.

Detected the presence of middle boxes and wrote to the ISPs, but they said that they have nothing deployed. Measurements run later on showed that the middlebox was no longer present.

Came across internet shutdowns while attempting to run ooniprobe in some African countries.

## Challenges

1. Big challenge is TRUST -- that was the main problem – getting someone to run ooniprobe. This limited the countries covered.

2. Getting organizations with LAN connections – an organization may be willing to do it, but they might only have wifi. So there are also technical challenges.

3. Getting people to run ooniprobe – it's a human challenge.

4. Hard to measure censorship beyond urban areas. The mobile app is a bit of a game changer, because it allows people to get measurements from much more remote areas.

5. Challenges from local partners --- (1) technical capacity, (2) apathy (why should they care? Why should they run ooniprobe?).

6. Hard to ship Raspberry Pis to certain African countries.

7. Meaning of all of this. When people do not see what exactly they are testing, they don't understand why they should be doing it. Data visualizations here are crucial.

8. Slow speeds are an issues, becase sometimes there is not enough bandwidth to even be able to run ooniprobe (??).

## Needs

1. Add a feature in the app through which you can choose which types of sites to test or not.

2. Case studies – point them out to new partners. Have success case studies of what came out of collecting data via ooniprobe.

3. Feature request, having the "Not Safe For Work" (NSFW) option.

4. What can we do to make ooniprobe something that people feel like they should do during election monitoring?

5. How do you quantify self-censorship?

6. Data visualizations/animations to explain to new users why all of this matters.
