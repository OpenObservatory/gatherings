# Sharing Partner Experience & Challenges: Latin America

## Experience

* Deployment of probes, before and after web UI.

* Much more mobile use.

## Challenges

1. Monitoring status of probes
2. Identifying probes beyond ASN --- privacy issues though
3. Comparing data about your probes and others in the country
4. Bandwidth usage
5. Private/federated data collection from probes
6. The HTTP invalid request line “hacking” disclaimer
7. Some people may not feel comfortable with Tor, and OONI being part of Tor. – Tor association.
8. It's challenging to download the image and burn it to an SD card.
9. Monitoring the probes is a bit of an issue. It's a bit of an issue to learn when a probe goes offline: currently how they do "monitoring" is they lookup the ASN on explorer and see if the measurements are coming in.
10. Compare the data from the probe monitoring your network vs the data that all probes have collected.
11. The concern of how much bandwidth is used by probes, quota management is appreciated.
12. Make visualisation on the explorer itself would be useful.

## Needs

1. Quotas for bandwidth
2. Optional usage IDs for probes
3. Being able to make simple data visualization on OONI Explorer web page – embedable? Share subsets of measurements – to be able to make data visualizations via OONI Explorer.
4. Maybe explain Tor association to OONI on website.
5. Consider deleting “hacking” disclaimer.
