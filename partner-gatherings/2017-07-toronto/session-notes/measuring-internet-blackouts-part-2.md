# Measuring internet blackouts - Part 2

## Methodology

* Frequent probes and reports (every 15m?)

* Cover all ISPs in the region

There are two open follow-up questions:

* Is there a reason to have extra broadband landline connection from another ISP for redundancy?

* What models of USB GSM dongles are used in India? Some of them are tending to hang and to require a power cycle that's not trivial to do automatically (most of USB hubs do not have power control).

## Next steps 

* Set up a lab in a region with frequent reported blackouts to run some experiments (probably a Raspberry Pi with some 3G dongles to it). 

* Find volunteers to run dev probes

* Hardware setup (RasPi 3, UPS, 5-6 Dongles, 64 GB SD card, powered USB hubs)

* Ship

* Scenarios: IP data, SMS, voice calls
