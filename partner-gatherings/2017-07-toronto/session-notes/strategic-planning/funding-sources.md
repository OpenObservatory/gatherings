# Mapping potential funding sources

List of funding options:

* OTF rapid response fund
* CIMA (part of Med)
* Ford Foundation: Internet freedom program and tech fellowship
* Mozilla Foundation
* MDF
* IDRC
* AccessNow
* SIDA
* Freedom House
* USAID - Digital Rights
* IREX
* Dutch Government
   
Election monitoring very well funded (EU has huge budget for this) - ooniprobe used for election monitoring
   
Differentiate between OONI funding and OONI partners funding, we have
to think about funders who are interested to fund not only OONI but also
partners.
   
* Micro Sponsorship:
    Asking big companies for money and give them recognition somehow
(score system) based on the impact they had on the project. No amount is
too low.
   
* Corporate Funding (Fb , Google)
   
* Funding as help, google summer of code
   
Partner needs:

* Having resources to dedicate a certain amount of hours or days to
dedicate completely to OONI activities.

* Getting help or resources to localize resources, technical help,
data visualization.

* Need funds for transportation, printing, travel, training,
advocacy and small activities.

* Pushing OONI to local partners to help spread it
   
* Collaboration with universities, for some research.
   
* Joint proposal between OONI and a partner.
